# Making_Embedded_Systems
Homework and Project documents for Green Turtle Cohort of Making Embedded Systems
----------

### Overview
This class is taught by Elicia White, Author of ["Making Embedded Systems: Design Patterns for Great Software"] (https://www.amazon.com/Making-Embedded-Systems-Patterns-Software/dp/1449302149). 
I participated in the 4th iteration of the course on [Classpert](https://classpert.com/) 

### Objectives
I have a background in electrical engineering but have primarily worked as a product guy. For a long time I have held an interest in embedded systems and have interfaced with both at work and as a hobby via Arduino and other hobbiest platforms. My motivation for taking this course was to imporve my understanding of the professional level tools, skills and processes used to desiging and creating embedded software.  

Areas I hope to improve through this course:
- C programming
- Markdown
- Git Hub useage 
- Setting up embedded development tool chains
- Debugging tools
- Embedded software architecture
- How to locate and identify quality code libraries for use in projects
